\section{Some concepts on Banach spaces}
This subchapter begins by introducing preliminary concepts on Banach spaces, which play a crucial role in the subsequent numerical methods to be presented. For more details see \cite{rudin1991functional} or \cite{brezis2011functional}. Consider a field \(\mathbb{F}\) (\(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\)). We say that a vector space \(E\) is a \textit{normed space} if there exists a map \(\norm*{\cdot}\) (called a \textit{norm}) over \(\mathbb{F}\) such that for every \(x, y \in E\)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\norm{\alpha x}= \abs{\alpha}\norm*{x}\), \(\alpha \in \mathbb{F}\);
    \item \(\norm{x + y} \leq \norm*{x} + \norm*{y}\);
    \item \(\norm*{x} \geq 0\);
    \item \(\norm*{x} = 0 \iff x=0\).
\end{enumerate}
In particular, a pivotal notion is of \textit{Banach spaces}, i.e., \(E\) is a Banach space if it is a complete normed space.
\begin{definition}\label{banach_op_def}
    Consider a linear operator \(T: \dom(T) \subset E \rightarrow F\), whose domain is represented by \(\dom(T)\), where \(E\) and \(F\) are Banach spaces with the associated norms \(\norm*{\cdot}_E\) and \(\norm*{\cdot}_F\), respectively. Then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \textbf{kernel} (also called the \textbf{nullspace}) of \(T\) is a subset of \(E\) such that
        \[
            \ker(T) = \{x \in E: Tx = 0\}.
        \]
        Accordingly, the \textbf{range} (also called the \textbf{image}) of \(T\) is a subset of \(F\) such that
        \[
            R(T) = \{y \in F: \text{ there exists some } x \in E \text{ such that } y = Tx\}.
        \]
        \item \(T\) is said to be \textbf{bounded} (continuous) if there exists \(C > 0\) such that \(\norm*{Tx}_F \leq C \norm*{x}_E\). The operator norm of \(T\) is defined as
        \[
            \norm{T} = \sup_{\substack{x \in E\\ x \neq 0}}\frac{\norm*{Tx}_F}{\norm*{x}_E}.
        \]
        In this case, we write \(T \in \mathcal{L}(E, F)\). If \(E=F\), we write \(T \in \mathcal{L}(E)\);

        \item The space of linear and continuous maps from \(E\) to \(\mathbb{R}\) is the \textbf{dual space} of \(E\) denoted by \(E^\star\). If \(S \in E^\star\), its norm (the dual norm) is defined in the same manner as the operator norm above, i.e.,
        \[
            \norm{S} = \sup_{\substack{x \in E\\ x \neq 0}}\frac{\abs{\langle S, x \rangle}}{\norm*{x}}
        \]
        where \(\langle S, x \rangle_{E^\star, E} = Sx\) and denotes de \textit{duality pairing} between \(E^\star\) and \(E\). As we will see below, it generalizes the notion of inner product in inner product spaces. Whenever it is obvious what dual pairing is being considered we just write \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\);
        \item Assuming that \(T\) is bounded, \(T\) is said to be \textbf{compact} if for any bounded sequence \((u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subset E\) there exists a subsequence \((u_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}\) such that \((T u_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}\) converges in \(F\);
        \item Assume that $\dom(T)$ is dense in \(E\). The linear operator \(T^\star: \dom(T^\star) \subset F^\star \rightarrow E^\star\) is said to be the \textbf{adjoint} of \(T\) if
        \[
            \langle v, T u \rangle_{F^\star, F} = \langle T^\star v, u \rangle_{E^\star, E}, \; \forall v \in \dom(T^\star),
        \]
        where the domain of \(T^\star\) is defined by
        \[
            \dom(T^\star) = \{v \in F^\star: \exists c \geq 0 \text{ such that } \abs{\langle v, T u \rangle_{F^\star, F}} \leq c \norm{u}, \; \forall u \in \dom(T)\}.
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
The main result of this section concerns the dual of a normed space. In reality, we do not need to assume that \(E\) is a Banach space to present the next results. However, throughout this work, every normed space is also complete. We refer to Chapters 1 and 3 from \cite{brezis2011functional}.
\begin{definition}[Reflexive space]\label{reflexive_space}
    Let \(E\) be a normed space and denote its dual by \(E^\star\). The bidual space \(E^{**}\) is the dual of \(E^\star\) with the associated norm
    \[
        \norm{\xi} = \sup_{\substack{f \in E^\star\\ f \neq 0}}\frac{\abs{\langle \xi, f \rangle}}{\norm*{f}}.
    \]
    If the (canonical) map \(J: E \rightarrow E^{**}\) defined by
    \[
        \langle J x, f \rangle_{E^{**}, E^\star} = \langle f, x \rangle_{E^\star, E}, \; \forall x \in E, \forall f \in E^\star
    \]
    is surjective then \(E\) is said to be \textit{reflexive}.
\end{definition}
The definition above is an important detail in the justification of the Method of Fundamental Solutions. The main ingredient to justify this numerical method is the Hahn-Banach Theorem.
% \gls{Hahn-Banach Theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Analytical form of Hahn-Banach Theorem]\label{hb_ana_form}
    Let \(E\) be a normed space and \(p: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) a functional satisfying
    \begin{align*}
        &p (\lambda x) = \lambda p(x), \; \lambda >0\\
        &p(x+y) \leq p(x) + p(y),
    \end{align*}
    for every \(x, y \in E\). Let \(G \subset E\) be a linear subspace and \(g: G \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) a linear functional such that
    \[
        g(x) \leq p(x), \; \forall x \in G.
    \]
    Then, there exists a linear functional \(f: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) that extends \(g\) to \(E\), coincides with \(g\) on \(G\), i.e., \(f(x) = g(x), \; \forall x \in G\) and also satisfies
    \[
        f(x) \leq p(x), \; \forall x \in E.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
    The Theorem mentioned above holds particular significance in Functional Analysis as it demonstrates that the dual \(E^\star\) of a normed space \(E\) possesses interesting properties which can be studied to gain a better understanding of the underlying space \(E\). It can even be utilized to identify, although not uniquely, elements in both \(E\) and its dual \(E^\star\) through duality pairing. This result bears a resemblance to the desirable properties exhibited by Hilbert spaces, which we will explore further in this chapter. Later, it will be used to establish the density of a subset in the whole space when working with the dual pairing between a Banach space and its dual. However, it is important to note that the existence of the functional \(f\) is not explicitly provided, as the proof of Theorem \ref{hb_ana_form} relies on the Axiom of Choice (Zorn's Lemma).
\end{remark}
Under some conditions, an interesting consequence of Theorem \ref{hb_ana_form} is that two disjoint (and non-empty) convex sets can always be separated by a hyperplane in an infinite-dimensional space.
\begin{definition}
    Let \(E\) be a normed space, \(f\) a linear functional on \(E\), and \(c \in \mathbb{R}\). A hyperplane \(H\) is a subset of \(E\) of the form
    \[
        H = \{x \in E: \langle f, x \rangle = c\}.
    \]
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    Let \(H\) be a hyperplane defined by the equation \(\langle f, x \rangle = c\), for some linear functional \(f\) and \(c \in \mathbb{R}\). Then, \(H\) is closed if and only if \(f\) is continuous.
\end{proposition}
Notice that if \(H\) is a closed hyperplane then the linear functional \(f\) that defines the hyperplane is an element of \(E^\star\).
\begin{definition}
    Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two subsets of \(E\). We say that a hyperplane \(H\) defined by the equation \(\langle f, x \rangle = c\), for some linear functional \(f\) and \(c \in \mathbb{R}\), \textit{strictly separates} \(A\) and \(B\) if
    \begin{align*}
        &\langle f, x \rangle < c, \; \forall x \in A,\\
        & \langle f, x \rangle > c, \; \forall x \in B.
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Second, geometric, form of the Hahn-Banach Theorem]\label{hb_geo_form}
    Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two disjoint, non-empty, and convex subsets of \(E\) such that \(A\) is closed and \(B\) is compact. Then, there exists a closed hyperplane that strictly separates \(A\) and \(B\), i.e., there exists \(f \in E^\star\) and \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) such that for every \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\)
    \[
        \langle f, a \rangle < c < \langle f, b \rangle.
    \]
\end{theorem}
The following Lemma is a consequence of Theorem \ref{hb_geo_form}, and it is a useful tool to prove that some linear subspace \(M \subset E\) is dense (in \(E\)). We start by introducing the notion of orthogonality in Banach spaces concerning duality pairing, see \cite{brezis2011functional} for more details.
\begin{definition}\label{banach_ortho_def}
    Let \(E\) be a Banach Space and \(M\) be a linear subspace of \(E\). We define the orthogonal of \(M\) in \(E\) in respect to the duality pairing as
    \[
        M^\perp = \{\psi \in E^\star: \langle \psi, \varphi \rangle = 0, \; \forall \varphi \in M\}.
    \]
    Accordingly, if \(N \subset E^\star\) is a linear subspace, its orthogonal is defined as
    \[
        N^\perp = \{\varphi \in E: \langle \psi, \varphi \rangle = 0, \; \forall \psi \in N\}
    \]
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}\label{banach_ortho_lemma}
    Let \(M\) and \(N\) satisfy the same conditions in the definition above. Then
    \[
        (M^\perp)^\perp = \overline{M}
    \]
    and
    \[
        \overline{N} \subset (N^\perp)^\perp.
    \]
    In particular, if \(E\) is a reflexive Banach space then
    \[
        (N^\perp)^\perp = \overline{N}.
    \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since \((M^\perp)^\perp \subset E\) and \((N^\perp)^\perp \subset E^\star\) are closed sets and by definition \(M \subset (M^\perp)^\perp\) and \(N \subset (N^\perp)^\perp\), then the inclusions
    \[
        \overline{M} \subseteq (M^\perp)^\perp, \qquad \overline{N} \subseteq (N^\perp)^\perp
    \]
    follow. To check that \((M^\perp)^\perp \subseteq \overline{M}\) we argue by contradiction. Let \(x_0 \in (M^\perp)^\perp\) such that \(x_0 \not \in \overline{M}\). Then, by Theorem \ref{hb_geo_form} there exists a hyperplane with equation \(\langle f, x \rangle = c\) for some \(f \in E^\star\) and \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) that strictly separates the sets \(\{x_0\}\) and \(\overline{M}\) (both are obviously non-empty convex sets). In particular,
    \[
        \langle f, x \rangle_{E^\star, E} < c < \langle f, x_0 \rangle_{E^\star, E}, \; \forall x \in M.
    \]
    Since \(M\) is a linear subspace, then \(\langle f, x \rangle = 0, \; \forall x \in M\) since, otherwise, given any \(x \in M\) we would have that
    \[
        \alpha \langle f, x \rangle_{E^\star, E} = \langle f, \alpha x \rangle_{E^\star, E} < c, \; \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{R}
    \]
    which can only be possible if \(\langle f, x \rangle_{E^\star, E} = 0\). Therefore, \(f \in M^\perp\) and \(\langle f, x_0 \rangle_{E^\star, E} > 0\) but that is a contradiction since, by hypothesis, \(x_0 \in (M^\perp)^\perp\) and \(\langle f, x_0 \rangle_{E^\star, E} = 0, \; \forall f \in M^\perp\).

    To prove that \((N^\perp)^\perp = \overline{N}\), we use the same type of argument. Let \(f_0 \in (N^\perp)^\perp\) such that \(f_0 \not \in \overline{N}\). Once again, there exists a hyperplane with equation \(\langle \xi, f \rangle = c\) for some \(\xi \in E^{**}\) and \(c \in \mathbb{R}\) that strictly separates \(\{f_0\}\) and \(\overline{N}\), that is
    \[
        \langle \xi, f \rangle < c < \langle \xi, f_0 \rangle, \; \forall f \in N.
    \]
    Since \(N\) is a linear subspace we can also conclude that \(\langle \xi, f \rangle = 0, \forall f \in N\) and \(\langle \xi, f_0 \rangle > 0\). In order to get a contradiction, like in the case above, since \(E\) is a reflexive space, then the canonical map \(J\) defined in \eqref{reflexive_space} is surjective, and we can write
    \[
        \langle \xi, f_0 \rangle_{E^{**}, E^\star} = \langle J x_0, f_0 \rangle_{E^{**}, E^\star} = \langle f_0, x_0 \rangle_{E^\star, E}
    \]
    for some \(x_0 \in E\). If we can prove that \(\langle f_0, x_0 \rangle_{E^\star, E} = 0\), then the contradiction follows. Since \(f_0 \in (N^\perp)^\perp\), then \(\langle f_0, x_0 \rangle_{E^\star, E} = 0\) if \(x_0 \in N^\perp\), i.e., \(\langle f, x_0 \rangle_{E^\star, E} = 0, \forall f \in N\). Let \(f \in N\). Then, by reflexivity,
    \[
        \langle f, x_0 \rangle_{E^\star, E} = \langle J x_0, f \rangle_{E^{**}, E^\star} = \langle \xi, f \rangle_{E^{**}, E^\star} = 0, \; \forall f \in N
    \]
    as we saw above (\(N\) is a linear subspace).
    The desired result follows.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}\label{chapt_preliminaries_remark_density_banach}
    The Lemma \ref{banach_ortho_lemma} will be used in justifying the Method of Fundamental Solutions. To prove that some subset \(N\) of \(E ^\star\) is dense in \(E\) and \(E^\star\) it will suffice to show that its orthogonal \(N^\perp\) contains only the trivial element, which belongs to both \(E\) and \(E^\star\).
\end{remark}

\section{Some concepts on Hilbert spaces}
% For more details c.f \cite{rudin1991functional}, \cite{brezis2011functional}, \cite{arendt2010partielle}.
In this section, we introduce some complementary results in Hilbert spaces. Once again, for more details, see \cite{rudin1991functional}, \cite{brezis2011functional}, or \cite{arendt2010partielle}. Consider the field \(\mathbb{F}\) (\(\mathbb{R}\) or \(\mathbb{C}\)). We say that a vector space \(H\) is an \textit{inner product space} (or a Pre-Hilbert space) if there exists a map \((\cdot,\cdot)\) (called an \textit{inner product}) over \(\mathbb{F}\) such that for every \(x, y \in H\)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \((x, y) = \overline{(y, x)}\) (The bar denotes complex conjugation if \(\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}\));
    \item \((x+y,z) = (x,z)+(y+z)\);
    \item \((\alpha x, y)=\alpha(x, y)\), \(\alpha \in \mathbb{F}\);
    \item \((x, x) \geq 0\);
    \item \((x, x) = 0 \iff x=0\).
\end{enumerate}
Given \(x, y \in H\), we say that \(x\) and \(y\) are orthogonal (denoted by \(x \perp y\)) if \((x, y) = 0\). Accordingly, given \(E, F \subset H\), if \(x\perp y\) for every \(x \in E, y \in F\) then we say that \(E\) and \(F\) are orthogonal, and write \(E \perp F\). We also denote by \(E^\perp\) the set of all \(y \in H\) orthogonal to every \(x \in E\), i.e., \(E^\perp = \{y \in H: (x, y)=0, \; \forall x \in E\}\) which we call the orthogonal complement of \(E\). We recall that every inner product space is also a normed space, where the inner product induces the norm
\[
\norm*{x} = \sqrt{(x, x)}
\]
satisfying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
\[
\abs{(x, y)} \leq \norm*{x}\norm*{y}, \; x, y \in H.
\]
Finally, if the normed space is complete for the induced norm, then we say that it is a Hilbert space. In what follows, \(H\) will always denote a Hilbert space.

\begin{example}
    A classical Hilbert space, which is used throughout this work, is the space of square-integrable real-valued functions in an open and bounded subset \(\Omega\) of \(\mathbb{R}^d\). This space is denoted by \(L^2(\Omega)\) with the inner product given by
    \[
    (f, g)_{L^2(\Omega)} = \int_\Omega f(x)g(x) dx.
    \]
    % If considering complex-valued functions, the inner product is given by
    % \[
    %     (f, g)_{L^2(\Omega)} = \int_\Omega f(x)\overline{g}(x) dx,
    % \]
    % where a bar over an expression represents the complex conjugate of the scalar (function).
\end{example}

In Hilbert spaces, proving the density of a subspace \(M \subset H\) is more intuitive and can be derived straightforwardly. The following results can be compared with Definition \eqref{banach_ortho_def} and Lemma \ref{banach_ortho_lemma}.

\begin{theorem}\label{hilb_decomp}
    Consider a closed subspace \(M \subset H\). Then,
    \[
    H = M \oplus M^\perp.
    \]
    In other words, every \(u \in H\) admits a unique decomposition \(u = v + w\), where \(v \in M\) and \(w \in M^\perp\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\label{hilb_dense}
    Consider a subspace \(M \subset H\). Then \(M\) is dense in \(H\) if and only if \(M^\perp = \{0\}\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(T = \overline{M}\). We want to prove that \(T = H\). Using Theorem \ref{hilb_decomp}, it suffices to check that \(T^\perp = \{0\}\). Since the inner product is continuous, then \(T^\perp = M^\perp = \{0\}\).

    On the other hand, since by definition \(T\) is closed, by Theorem \ref*{hilb_decomp} we have that \(H = T \oplus T^\perp = T \oplus \{0\} = T\) as we wished.
\end{proof}

A fundamental result in Hilbert spaces is the fact that every linear and continuous function \(T: H \rightarrow \mathbb{F}\) can be \textit{represented} by some unique element in \(H\). In what follows we assume that \(\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}\).
\begin{theorem}[Riesz Representation Theorem]\label{riesz}
    Let \(T: H \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be a linear and continuous functional. Then, there exists a unique \(u \in H\) such that
    \[
        T v = (u, v), \; \forall v \in H.
    \]
    Moreover, let \(H^\star\) be the dual space of \(H\). Then the map \(H^\star \mapsto H\) is an isometric isomorphism (which we denote by \(\approxeq\)) where
    \[
        \norm*{u}_H = \norm*{T}_{H^\star}.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
    Notice how the inner product in Hilbert spaces has replaced the duality pairing defined in Banach spaces. In fact, Riesz Representation Theorem \ref{riesz} allows us to make a stronger statement regarding the dual spaces of Hilbert spaces and work in a more natural framework without ever resorting to the Hahn-Banach Theorem \ref{hb_ana_form}. For example, it is interesting to observe that the definition of orthogonality and orthogonal subspaces in Hilbert spaces (via the inner product) and Banach spaces (via the duality pairing) are essentially the same, with the distinction being an isomorphism between the Hilbert space and its dual. However, in certain cases, working with the definition of orthogonality in Banach spaces can be more useful as it allows for a better generalization, as in proving the density of a closed subspace.
\end{remark}

A generalization of the Theorem \ref{riesz} is the Lax-Milgram Theorem.

\begin{definition}
   A bilinear form \(a: H \times H \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is continuous and coercive if there exists some constants \(C >0\) and \(\alpha >0\) such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\abs{a(u,v)} \leq C \norm*{u}\norm*{v}, \; \forall u, v \in H\),
        \item \(a(u,u) \geq \alpha \norm*{u}^2, \; \forall u \in H\),
    \end{itemize}
    respectively.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Lax-Milgram Theorem]\label{lax-milgram}
    Let \(a(\cdot,\cdot)\) be a bilinear, continuous, and coercive bilinear form on \(H\). If \(T\) is a linear and continuous functional in \(H\), then there exists a unique \(u \in H\) such that
    \[
        a(u, v) = T(v), \; \forall v \in H.
    \]
\end{theorem}

Aiming at stating the well-known Spectral theorem, we will first present some key results and concepts (without proof).

\begin{definition}
    A sequence \((e_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in H\) is a Hilbert basis of \(H\) if
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \((e_n, e_m) = \begin{cases}
            1, & n=m\\
            0, & n \neq m
        \end{cases}\);
        \item \(\overline{\Span\{(e_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\}} = H\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
In a sense, a Hilbert basis resembles a basis in a finite-dimensional vector space.
\begin{proposition}\label{hilb_basis}
    Let $(e_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a Hilbert basis of $H$. Then, for every $u \in H$, one can write
    \[
        u = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{N}} (u, e_k)e_k \quad \text{and} \quad \|u\|^2 = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{N}} |(u, e_k)|.
    \]
    The last equality is known as \textit{Parseval's identity}.
\end{proposition}
The proposition \ref{hilb_basis} is particularly interesting because it allows us to express every element of \(H\) in terms of a countable basis. Theorem \ref{hilb_separable} below guarantees the existence of a Hilbert basis.
\begin{definition}
    We say that \(H\) is a separable Hilbert space if there exists a countable subset \(M \subset H\) such that \(\overline{M} = H\).
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}\label{hilb_separable}
    Every separable Hilbert space admits an orthonormal Hilbert basis.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
    Consider a linear operator \(T: H_1 \rightarrow H_2\), where \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) are Hilbert spaces.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Assume that \(H = H_1=H_2\) and \(T \in \mathcal{L}(H)\). \(T^\star\) is said to be the \textbf{adjoint} of \(T\) if
        \[
        (y, T x) = (T^\star y, x), \; \forall x, y \in H;
        \]
        If \(T=T^\star\), i.e., if the domains (and images) of \(T\) and \(T^\star\) coincide then \(T\) is said to be \textbf{self-adjoint}.\footnote{The existence and uniqueness of \(T^\star\) may not be obvious, but if follows from Riesz Representation Theorem \ref{riesz}. In any case, notice the similarities between this definition and the one given in Definition \eqref{banach_op_def}. In fact, in Banach spaces, the existence of the adjoint also follows from the Hahn-Banach Theorem \ref{hb_ana_form}!}
    \item Let \(T \in \mathcal{L}(H)\) and $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$. The \textbf{resolvent set} of $T$ is defined as
        \[
            \rho(T) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}: T - \lambda I \text{ is bijective from } H \text{ to } H\}
        \]
            and $\sigma(T) = \mathbb{R} \setminus \rho(T)$ is called the \textbf{spectrum} of $T$. One says that \(\lambda \in \mathbb{F}\) is an \textbf{eigenvalue} \footnote{Remarkably, in the infinite-dimensional case, the set of eigenvalues may not coincide with the spectrum \(\sigma(T)\). \(T - \lambda I\) may fail to be invertible even if \(T - \lambda I\) is injective.}  of \(T\) if \(\ker(T - \lambda I) \neq \{0\}\). Also, \(u\) is said to be an \textbf{eigenvector} associated with the eigenvalue \(\lambda\) if \(u \in \ker(T-\lambda I)\setminus \{0\}\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Next, we present some important properties regarding the spectrum of a compact operator and of a self-adjoint operator.
\begin{proposition}
    Let \(H\) be a Hilbert space and consider a compact operator \(T \in \mathcal{L}(H)\). Then,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(0 \in \sigma(T)\);
        \item one of the following holds:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(\sigma(T) = \{0\}\);
            \item \(\sigma(T)\setminus\{0\}\) is a finite set;
            \item \(\sigma(T)\setminus\{0\}\) is a sequence converging to \(0\).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
    Let \(H\) be a Hilbert space and consider a self-adjoint operator \(T\in \mathcal{L}(H)\). Then, \(\sigma(T)\) is real and the eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.
\end{proposition}
It is now possible to state one of the main results of this section.
\begin{theorem}[Spectral Theorem for compact and self-adjoint operators]\label{spectral_theorem}
    Let \(H\) be a separable Hilbert space of infinite dimension and let \(T \in \mathcal{L}(H)\) be a compact self-adjoint operator. Then, \(H\) admits a Hilbert basis \((e_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) such that
    \[
        T e_n = \lambda_n e_n
    \]
    for \(\lambda_n \in \mathbb{R}\), \(\lambda_n \rightarrow 0\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\), where \(\lambda_n\) can be assumed to be a decreasing sequence.
\end{theorem}
% Besides Theorem \ref{spectral_theorem}, equations of the type \((I-T)u = f\), where \(T\) is a bounded compact operator and \(f \in H\), can be studied with the help of Fredholm alternative that we now state.
% \begin{theorem}[Fredholm Alternative]
%     Let \(T\) be a compact operator from \(H\) to \(H\). Then
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item \(N(I-T)\) has finite dimension;
%         \item \(R(I-T)\) is closed and \(R(I-T)=N(I-T^\star)^\perp\);
%         \item \(N(I-T) = \{0\} \iff R(I-T) = E\);
%         \item \(\dim N(I-T) = \dim N(I-T^\star)\).
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{remark}
%     In fact, the Theorem above is even true for a general Banach space \(E\). Observe that it gives an \textit{alternative} regarding the solvability of the equation \((I-T)u = f\). To be more precise,
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item or \((I-T)u = f\) as a unique solution for every \(f \in H\),
%         \item or \(n = N(I-T) > 0\) and \((I-T)u = 0\) admits \(n\) linearly independent solutions.
%     \end{itemize}
%     Particularly, under the conditions of the Theorem \ref{spectral_theorem}, if \(\lambda\) is not an eigenvalue of \(T\), then the equation \(\frac{T}{\lambda}u = u\) must have a unique solution. This result is particularly useful when studying the Laplace operator in the next chapters.

\section{Lebesgue and Sobolev Spaces}\label{lebesgue_and_sobolev_preliminaries}
% For more details c.f \cite{brezis2011functional}, \cite{borthwick2020spectral}, \cite{lions2012non} and \cite{evans2022partial}.
In this subchapter, we make a brief introduction to Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces theory. The results presented in this section can be found, e.g., in \cite{lions2012non} and \cite{evans2022partial}. The lecture notes \cite{huguinho} were also consulted. Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be an open set. Consider a \textit{multi-index} $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_d) \in \mathbb{N}_0^d$, and let $|\alpha| = \alpha_1 + \dots + \alpha_d$. Given a function \(u\) defined in $\Omega$, we denote its partial derivatives of order $\alpha$ by
\[
D^\alpha u = \frac{\partial^{|\alpha|}}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1}\dots\partial x_d^{\alpha_d}}u.
\]
As usual, we denote the space of test functions with compact support in $\Omega$ by
\[
\mathcal{D}(\Omega) = C_0^\infty(\Omega) = \{\varphi \in C^\infty(\Omega) : \supp\varphi \text{ is compact in }\Omega\}.
\]

\begin{definition}[Lebesgue spaces]
    Let \(1 \leq p \leq \infty\). We define the Lebesgue space (\(L^p\) space)
    \[
        L^p(\Omega) = \Big\{u: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}: u \text{ is measurable and } \int_\Omega \abs*{f}^p dx < \infty\Big\}
    \]
    with the associated norm
    \[
        \norm*{f}_{L^p(\Omega)} = \Biggl(\int_\Omega \abs*{f}^p dx\Biggr)^{\frac{1}{p}}.
    \]
    If \(p=\infty\) we set
    \[
        L^\infty(\Omega) = \Big\{u: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}: u \text{ is measurable and } \exists C > 0: \abs*{f(x)} \leq C \text{ a.e. on } \Omega \Big\}
    \]
    with the associated norm
    \[
        \norm*{f}_{L^\infty(\Omega)} = \inf \{C: \abs*{f(x)} \leq C \text{ a.e. on } \Omega\}.
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    We say that \(f \in L^1_{\text{loc}}(\Omega)\) if \(f\) is integrable in every compact \(K \subset \Omega\), i.e.,
    \[
        f \chi_K \in L^1(\Omega), \; \forall K \subset \Omega \text{ compact},
    \]
    where \(\chi_k\) is the characteristic function of the set \(K\) given by
    \[
        \chi_k(x) = \begin{cases}
            1 & \text{ if } x \in K\\
            0 & \text{ if } x \not\in K.
        \end{cases}
    \]
    This definition can be extended accordingly to every \(L^p (\Omega)\) space, with \(1 \leq p \leq \infty\).
\end{definition}
Before introducing the notion of weak derivative in Sobolev spaces, it will be useful to dive into some Distribution theory. Consider the space of test functions \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega) \coloneqq C_0^\infty(\Omega)\).
While we are not interested in defining a topology in this space, we want to characterize linear and continuous functionals acting on \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\). For now, it suffices to define (sequential) convergence in \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\).
\begin{definition}
    For all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), let \((\varphi_n)_n \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega)\) and \(\varphi \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega)\). If
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item   \(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}\) there exists a compact set \(K \subseteq \Omega\) such \(\supp \varphi_n \subseteq K\);
        \item \(\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{N}_0^d, \; \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \norm*{D^\alpha \varphi_n - D^\alpha \varphi}_{L^\infty(\Omega)} = 0\)
    \end{enumerate}
    then we say that \(\varphi_n\) converges to \(\varphi\) in \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Space of distributions]
    The dual space of \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\), denoted by \(\mathcal{D}^\star(\Omega)\), is called the space of distributions, and we say that any element belonging to \(\mathcal{D}^\star\) is a distribution.
\end{definition}
A very illustrative example, with consequences when defining the duality pairing in Sobolev spaces, is that any locally integrable function \(u \in L^1_{\text{loc}}(\Omega)\) defines a distribution. It is easy to prove that the operator \(T_u\) defined by
\begin{align*}
    T_u: \mathcal{D}(\Omega) &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\
    \varphi &\mapsto \int_\Omega u \varphi dx
\end{align*}
is linear and continuous. Therefore, one can give meaning to the action of a distribution over a test function, whenever the distribution is induced by a locally integrable function \(u\). In this case, we can write
\[
    \langle u, \varphi \rangle_{D^\star(\Omega), D(\Omega)} = \int_\Omega u \varphi dx
\]
where the duality pairing \( \langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle_{D^\star(\Omega), D(\Omega)}\) can be seen as a generalization of the \(L^2(\Omega)\) inner product.

\begin{definition}[Sobolev Spaces]
    For \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(1 \leq p \leq \infty\) we define the Sobolev space
    \[
    W^{k,p}(\Omega) = \{u \in L^p(\Omega): D^\alpha u \in L^p(\Omega), \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{N}_0^d: \abs{\alpha} \leq k\}
    \]
    with the associated norms
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(1 \leq p < \infty\),
            \[
            \norm*{u}_{W^{k,p}(\Omega)} = \Bigl(\sum_{\abs{\alpha} \leq k} \norm{D^\alpha u}_{L^p(\Omega)}^p\Bigr)^{\frac{1}{p}};
            \]
            \item \(p = \infty\),
            \[
            \norm*{u}_{W^{k,p}(\Omega)} = \max_{\abs{\alpha} \leq k} \norm{D^\alpha u}_{L^\infty(\Omega)}.
            \]
    \end{itemize}

\end{definition}
We say that \(D^\alpha u\) is the weak derivative of order \(\alpha\) of \(u \in L^p(\Omega)\) if \(D^\alpha u \in L^p(\Omega)\). The operator \(D^\alpha\) is well-defined as a distribution and satisfies
\[
    \int_\Omega D^\alpha u \varphi dx = (-1)^\abs{\alpha} \int_\Omega u D^\alpha \varphi dx, \; \forall \varphi \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega).
\]
Throughout this work, we are mainly concerned with Sobolev spaces when \(p=2\). In this case, we write \(H^k(\Omega) \coloneqq W^{k, 2}(\Omega)\) which is a Hilbert space for the inner product\footnote{Observe that if \(k=0\) then \(H^0(\Omega) = L^2(\Omega)\).}
\[
 (u, v) \coloneqq \sum_{\abs{\alpha} \leq k} (D^\alpha u, D^\alpha v)_{L^2(\Omega)}.
\]
One of the main tools used in obtaining the spectral decomposition of the Laplace operator (see Appendix \ref{div_theo}) is the following Embedding Theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Rellich Theorem]\label{rellich}
    Assume that \(\Omega\) is a bounded Lipschitz domain. Then, the embedding \(H^1(\Omega) \rightarrow L^2(\Omega)\) is compact, i.e., given a bounded sequence \((u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subset H^1(\Omega)\) there exists a convergent subsequence \((u_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \subset L^2(\Omega)\).
\end{theorem}

So far we have restricted our definition of Sobolev spaces to \(k \in \mathbb{N}\), but it is entirely feasible to extend these spaces to fractional Sobolev spaces using a real exponent \(s \in \mathbb{R}_0^+\). While various approaches can be employed for this extension, when \(p=2\) it can be readily achieved through Fourier Transforms.

\begin{lemma}
    Let \(u \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)\). Then
    \[
    u \in H^k(\mathbb{R}^d) \iff (1+ \abs{\xi}^k)\hat{u} \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)
    \]
    where \(\hat{u} = \mathcal{F}u\) denotes the Fourier Transform of \(u\), given by \(\mathcal{F}u(\xi) = \hat{u}(\xi) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} e^{-2 \pi x \xi} u(x) dx\).
\end{lemma}

The above characterization of the \(H^k(\mathbb{R}^d)\) space motivates the following definition.

\begin{definition}\label{def_fractional_sobolev}
    Let \(s \in \mathbb{R}\). The fractional Sobolev space \(H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)\) is defined as
    \[
    H^s(\mathbb{R}^d) = \{u \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d): (1+ \abs{\xi}^2)^\frac{s}{2}\hat{u} \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)\}
    \]
    with the norm
    \[
        \norm*{u}_{H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)} = \norm*{(1+ \abs{\xi}^2)^\frac{s}{2} \hat{u}}_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)}.
    \]
\end{definition}
The definition \ref{def_fractional_sobolev} only holds for functions defined over the whole space \(\mathbb{R}^d\). In this work, we are mainly concerned with the behavior over a bounded set \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d\). Unfortunately, there are multiple definitions of fractional Sobolev spaces over a bounded set that may not agree between themselves if the boundary of \(\Omega\) is not smooth enough (if the boundary fails to be parameterized by a continuous function, for example). In any case, the following definition suffices for this work, see \cite{bogomolny1985fundamental}, \cite{chandler2017sobolev} or \cite{hewett2017note}.
\begin{definition}
    Let \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) be a bounded set with a Lipschitz boundary. Define
    \[
        \mathring{H}^s(\Omega) = \{v \in H^s(\mathbb{R}^d): \supp v \subset \overline{\Omega}\}.
    \]
    Then, the fractional Sobolev space \(H^s(\Omega)\) is defined as
    \[
        H^s(\Omega) = H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)\setminus \mathring{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^d\setminus\Omega).
    \]
    The norm of a function \(u \in H^s(\Omega)\) is given by
    \[
        \norm*{u}_{H^s(\Omega)} = \inf \{\norm*{\Tilde{u}}_{H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)}: \Tilde{u} \in H^s(\mathbb{R}^d), \; \Tilde{u}_{|\Omega} = u\}.
    \]
\end{definition}

Fractional Sobolev spaces are important for our study because they are deeply related to the boundary behavior of a given function. For example, if \(u \in H^1(\Omega)\) and \(\Omega\) is a bounded Lipschitz domain, then \(u_{|\partial\Omega} \in H^\frac{1}{2}(\partial\Omega)\). However, the statement above must be defined rigorously: not only \(u\) is only defined in the open set \(\Omega\), but \(u\) is only defined \textit{almost everywhere} and the Lebesgue measure of \(\partial\Omega\) is zero. Intuitively, we consider the continuous extension of functions from \(\Omega\) to the boundary \(\partial\Omega\) which is only possible if the domain is regular \textit{enough}\footnote{We refer to Appendix \ref{appendix_truea} where we briefly study domain regularity and the notion of Sobolev spaces on manifolds, such as the boundary of a Lipschitz domain.}. This is done in the context of trace theory, cf. \cite{geymonat2007trace}, \cite{necas2011direct} or \cite{adams2003sobolev}.
\begin{theorem}\label{frac_theo}
    Let \(\Omega\) be a bounded set with a Lipschitz boundary. Then, there exists a linear and continuous mapping called the trace operator
    \[
    \gamma_0: H^1(\Omega) \rightarrow H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\partial\Omega)
    \]
    that admits a bounded right inverse represented by \(\gamma_0^{-1}\).

    In particular, if \(u \in H^2(\Omega)\), then \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_j} \in H^1(\Omega)\) for \(j=1,\dots,d\) and the operator
    \begin{align*}
        \gamma_1: H^2(\Omega) &\rightarrow L^2(\partial\Omega)\\
        u &\mapsto \gamma_0(\nabla u)\cdot n
    \end{align*}
    is linear and continuous\footnote{One may understand \(\gamma_0\) here as an elementwise operator, where \(\gamma_0(\nabla u) = \Big(\gamma_0(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}),\dots,\gamma_0(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_d})\)\Big).} and generalizes the notion of the normal derivative (denoted by \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\)) on the boundary \(\partial\Omega\) for a function \(u \in H^2(\Omega)\).
\end{theorem}
The result above is stated in a very weak form since we are working in Lipschitz domains. If $\Omega$ is a smooth domain, then $\gamma_1: H^2(\Omega) \rightarrow H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\partial\Omega)$, cf. \cite{lions2012non}. An important (closed) subspace of \(H^1(\Omega)\) is the kernel of the trace operator \(\gamma_0\),
\[
    \ker \gamma_0 = \{u \in H^1(\Omega): \gamma_0 u = 0\} \eqqcolon H^1_0(\Omega)
\]
which can be equivalently defined as the closure of \(\overline{\mathcal{D}(\Omega)}\) in the \(H^1(\Omega)\) norm, i.e.,  \(H^1_0(\Omega) \coloneqq \overline{\mathcal{D}(\Omega)}^{H^1(\Omega)}\). It should be noted that the normal derivative operator $\gamma_1$ cannot be defined if we only assume that $u \in H^1(\Omega)$. If such a continuous operator $\mathcal{N}$ existed, then $\mathcal{N}\varphi = 0$ for every $\varphi \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega)$. By continuity, this would imply $\mathcal{N}u=0$ for all $u \in H_0^1(\Omega)$, leading to a contradiction.

\(H^1_0(\Omega)\) is of major importance in the Dirichlet Laplacian problem, since the functions in \(H^1_0(\Omega)\) ``vanish'' on \(\partial\Omega\). Next, we state an important result to be used when studying the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian.
\begin{theorem}[Poincaré inequality]
    Let \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) be a bounded set. Define \(W^{1, p}_0(\Omega) \coloneqq \overline{\mathcal{D}(\Omega)}^{W^{1, p}(\Omega)}\). Then, there exists \(C > 0\) such that
    \[
        \norm*{u}_{L^p(\Omega)} \leq C \norm*{\nabla u}_{L^p(\Omega)}, \; \forall u \in W^{1, p}(\Omega).
    \]
\end{theorem}

Finally, we shed some light on the dual space of Sobolev spaces (with fractional exponent). In \(\mathbb{R}^d\) one can prove the following result, cf. \cite{chen2010boundary} or \cite{hormander2015analysis}.
\begin{theorem}
    Let \(s \in \mathbb{R}\) and \(u \in H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)\). Then, any linear and continuous functional \(T \in (H^s(\mathbb{R}^d))^\star\) that acts in \(H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)\) can be uniquely represented by some \(v \in H^{-s}(\mathbb{R}^d)\) and the duality pairing is given by
    \[
        \langle T, u \rangle_{(H^s(\mathbb{R}^d))^\star, H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)} = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \hat{u} \bar{\hat{v}}d \xi = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} (1+ \abs{\xi}^2)^{\frac{s}{2}}\hat{u}(1+ \abs{\xi}^{2})^{-\frac{s}{2}}\bar{\hat{v}}d \xi \leq \norm*{u}_{H^s(\Omega)}\norm*{v}_{H^{-s}(\Omega)}
    \]
    where \(\hat{u}\) and \(\hat{v}\) represent the Fourier Transforms of \(u\) and \(v\), respectively. In particular, the dual of \(H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)\) is isomorphic to \(H^{-s}(\mathbb{R}^d)\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}\label{preliminaries_chapter_duality_pairing_def_remark}
    Considering the inclusion \(\mathcal{D}(\Omega) \subset H^s(\Omega)\), it is straightforward to observe that \((H^s(\Omega))^\star \subset D^\star(\Omega)\) which implies that \(L^2(\Omega) \subset (H^{s}(\Omega))^\star \approxeq H^{-s}(\Omega)\). Consequently, based on the preceding Theorem, we note that Sobolev spaces with negative exponent \(s\) can be regarded as spaces of distributions with the following inclusions:
    \[
        H^{s}(\Omega) \subset L^2(\Omega) \subset H^{-s}(\Omega).
    \]
    In this case, one can consider \(L^2(\Omega)\) as a \textit{pivot} space, and by virtue of the identification of \(L^2(\Omega)\) with its dual, the duality pairing \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_{H^{-s}(\Omega), H^s(\Omega)}\) and the \(L^2(\Omega)\) inner product coincide for every \(u \in H^s(\Omega)\) and
    \begin{equation}\label{preliminaries_chapter_duality_pairing_def}
        \langle v, u \rangle_{H^{-s}(\Omega), H^s(\Omega)} = \int_{\Omega} u v dx
    \end{equation}
    whenever it makes sense, i.e., when \(v \in L^2(\Omega)\).
     %\rangle_{H^{-s}(\Omega), H^s(\Omega)} = \int_{\Omega} u v
\end{remark}

Theorem \ref{frac_theo} allows to give some meaning to the space \(H^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\Omega)\). Let \(u \in H^2(\Omega)\) and \(v \in H^\frac{1}{2}(\partial\Omega)\). Then, \(\gamma_0^{-1}v \in H^1(\Omega)\) and by Green's formula (see the Appendix \ref{div_theo})
\[
    \langle \gamma_1 u, v \rangle_{H^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\partial\Omega), H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\partial\Omega)} = \int_\Omega \Delta u \gamma_0^{-1}v dx + \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla \gamma_0^{-1}v dx
\]
we have \(\gamma_1 u \in H^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\Omega)\).

%\section{Spectral Decomposition of the Laplace operator}\label{div_theo}
% In this section, we make a brief study regarding the Laplace operator \(-\Delta = -\sum_{n=1}^{d} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_n^2}\) in a bounded domain \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) with Lipschitz boundary. Firstly, we recall the Divergence Theorem, e.g. \cite{evans2015measure}.
% \begin{theorem}[Divergence Theorem]
%     Let \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) defined as above. Then,
%     \[
%       \int_\Omega \Div \phi dx = \int_{\partial\Omega} \phi \cdot \mathbf{n} d\sigma,
%     \]
%     where \(\mathbf{n}\) denotes the exterior unitary normal.
% \end{theorem}
% A main consequence of the Divergence Theorem are the well-known \textit{Green's Formulas}, with major importance in this work.
% \begin{corollary}[Green's Formulas]
%     In this same conditions of the Theorem \ref{div_theo}, let \(u, v \in H^2(U)\). Then,
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item \(\int_\Omega \Delta u dx = \int_{\partial \Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} d\sigma\);
%         \item \(\int_\Omega \Delta u v dx = -\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx + \int_{\partial \Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v d\sigma\);
%         \item \(\int_\Omega \Delta u v - u \Delta v dx= \int_{\partial \Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v - \frac{\partial v}{\partial n}u d\sigma\).
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{corollary}

% The study of the spectrum of the following equation is of major importance throughout this work and will be studied in the following chapter. For now, we will only state and prove a classical result which can also be found in numerous textbooks, see \cite{brezis2011functional} \cite{arendt2010partielle}, \cite{courant2008methods} or \cite{borthwick2020spectral}. While we assume null Dirichlet boundary conditions, we notice that the Neumann case is analogous.

% \begin{definition}\label{eig_def}
%     Consider the Helmholtz equation with null Dirichlet boundary conditions
%     \begin{equation}\label{eig_helm_eq}
%         \begin{cases}
%             -\Delta u(x) = \lambda u(x), & x \in \Omega, \\
%             u(x) = 0, & x \in \partial \Omega,
%         \end{cases}
%     \end{equation}
%     where $\Delta=\sum_{i=0}^{d}\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial x_i^2}$. Then, \(\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\) is an eigenvalue of the equation \eqref{eig_helm_eq} if there exists an eigenfunction \(u \neq 0\) belonging to the function spaces \(C^2(\Omega) \cap C(\overline{\Omega})\).
% \end{definition}

% \begin{theorem}\label{spec_lap_pre}
%     There exists a Hilbert basis \((u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) of \(L^2(\Omega)\) consisting of eigenfunctions \(u_n\) of \(-\Delta\), i.e., for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) there exists a pair eigenvalue/eigenfunction \((\lambda_n, u_n)\) such that
%     \[
%         -\Delta u_n = \lambda_n u_n
%     \]
%     where the sequence of eigenvalues can be ordered in increasing order and \(\lambda_n \rightarrow \infty, \; n \rightarrow \infty\). In particular, define \(E_n = \Span\{u_1, \dots, u_n\}\) and the Rayleigh Quotient
%     \[
%         R(u) = \frac{\norm*{\nabla u}^2_{L^2(\Omega)}}{\norm*{u}^2_{L^2(\Omega)}}.
%     \]
%     Then,
%     \[
%     \lambda_n = \min_{\substack{u \in E^\perp_{n-1} \\ u \neq 0}} R(u) = \max_{\substack{u \in E_n \\ u \neq 0}} R(u).
%     \]
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%     For each \(f \in L^2(\Omega)\), we consider the problem
%     \[
%         \begin{cases}
%             -\Delta u(x) = f, & \text{ in } \Omega\\
%             u = 0, & \text{ on } \partial \Omega
%         \end{cases}
%     \]
%     with the associated variational form
%     \[
%         \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \int_\Omega f v, \; \forall v \in H^1_0(\Omega).
%     \]
%     Using Lax-Milgram Theorem \ref{lax-milgram}, it is straightforward to prove that the variational form above admits a unique weak solution \(u \in H^1_0(\Omega)\) and the operator
%     \begin{align*}
%         T: L^2(\Omega) &\rightarrow L^2(\Omega)\\
%         f &\mapsto u
%     \end{align*}
%     is well-defined. To prove that \(T\) is a compact operator, we use Poincaré and Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities and notice that
%     \[
%         \alpha\norm*{u}_{H^1(\Omega)}^2 \leq \int_\Omega \abs{\nabla u}^2 = \int_\Omega f u \leq \norm*{f}_{L^2(\Omega)}\norm*{u}_{L^2(\Omega)} \leq \norm*{f}_{L^2(\Omega)}\norm*{u}_{H^1(\Omega)} \implies \norm*{u}_{H^1(\Omega)} \leq C \norm*{f}_{L^2(\Omega)}
%     \]
%     where \(\alpha, C > 0\). The above result can be written as
%     \[
%         \norm*{Tf}_{H^1(\Omega)} \leq C \norm*{f}_{L^2(\Omega)}, \; \forall f \in L^2(\Omega)
%     \]
%     and by Theorem \ref{rellich} \(T\) is a compact operator. To check that \(T\) is self-adjoint it suffices to consider the weak variational form of the null Dirichlet boundary problems
%     \[
%         -\Delta u = f \qquad -\Delta v = g
%     \]
%     for \(f,g \in L^2(\Omega)\) and apply Green's formulas. It is also easy to see that \((Tf, f)_{L^2(\Omega)} \geq 0, \forall f \in L^2(\Omega)\) since
%     \[
%         \int_\Omega (Tf) f = \int_\Omega u f = \norm{\nabla u}_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 \geq 0.
%     \]
%     Applying the Spectral Theorem \ref{spectral_theorem} to \(T\), there exists a Hilbert basis \((u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) such that
%     \[
%         T u_n = \mu_n u_n
%     \]
%     for \(\mu_n \in \mathbb{R}\), \(\mu_n \rightarrow 0\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\). In particular, taking \(f = \lambda_n u_n\), where \(\lambda_n = \frac{1}{\mu_n}\), one can write
%     \[
%         -\Delta u_n = \lambda_n u_n,
%     \]
%     or in the integral form
%     \[
%         \int_\Omega \abs*{\nabla u}^2 = \lambda_n \int_\Omega u^2,
%     \]
%     with \(\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \dots \rightarrow \infty\). To check the variational form of the eigenvalues \(\lambda_n\), let \(u \in E_{n-1}^\perp\). Then,
%     \begin{align*}
%         \norm*{\nabla u}_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 = (\nabla u, \nabla u)_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 &= \Big(\sum_{m\geq n} (u, u_m)_{L^2(\Omega)} \nabla u_m, \nabla u \Big)_{L^2(\Omega)}\\
%         &=\sum_{m\geq n} (u, u_m)_{L^2(\Omega)} (\nabla u_m, \nabla u)_{L^2(\Omega)}\\
%         &=\sum_{m\geq n} \lambda_m (u, u_m)_{L^2(\Omega)} (u_m, u)_{L^2(\Omega)}\\
%         & \geq \lambda_n \sum_{m\geq n} \abs{(u, u_m)_{L^2(\Omega)}}^2\\
%         &= \lambda_n \norm*{u}_{L^2(\Omega)}^2
%     \end{align*}
%     where we used the bilinearity of the inner product, the fact that the sequence \(\lambda_n\) is non-decreasing, and Parseval's identity. It is easy to check that the equality is only attained if and only if \(u\) is in the eigenspace of \(\lambda_k\). This proves that
%     \[
%         \lambda_n = \min_{\substack{u \in E^\perp_{n-1} \\ u \neq 0}} R(u).
%     \]
%     The other case is analogous.
% \end{proof}
% \begin{remark}
%     Observe that \eqref{spec_lap_pre} only guarantees that the eigenfunctions \(u_n\) belong to \(H^1_0(\Omega)\). In order to achieve the regularity stated in Definition \eqref{eig_def}, some conditions on \(\Omega\) should be imposed: for example, if \(\Omega\) is an open set of class \(C^2\). If \(\Omega\) is smooth, then \(u_n \in C^\infty(\overline{\Omega})\).
% \end{remark}

% \begin{corollary}[Homogeneity]\label{lap_homo}
%     Let \(\alpha > 0\). Consider the set
%     \[
%         \alpha \Omega = \{\alpha x \in \mathbb{R}^d: x \in \Omega\},
%     \]
%     i.e., \(\alpha \Omega\) is a dilation of \(\Omega\) by a factor of scale \(\alpha\).
%     Then, for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\),
%     \[
%         \alpha^2 \lambda_n(\alpha \Omega) = \lambda_n(\Omega),
%     \]
%     where \(\lambda_n(\alpha \Omega)\) is the \(n\)-esim eigenvalue of \eqref{eig_helm_eq} on the domain \(\alpha \Omega\) (and analogously for \(\lambda_n(\Omega)\)).
% \end{corollary}

% \begin{proof}
%     The proof is an easy consequence of the variational description above. Let \(\varphi(x) = \alpha x\) and \(\alpha \Omega = \phi(\Omega)\). Then,
%     \begin{equation*}
%         \lambda_n(\alpha \Omega) = \min_{\substack{u \in E^\perp_{n-1} \\ u \neq 0}}  \frac{\int_{\varphi(\Omega)} \abs{\nabla u(x)}^2 dx}{\int_{\varphi(\Omega)} u(x)^2 dx} = \min_{\substack{u \in E^\perp_{n-1} \\ u \neq 0}} \frac{\int_{\Omega} \abs{\nabla u(\alpha x)}^2 dx}{\int_{\Omega} u(\alpha x)^2 dx},
%     \end{equation*}
%     via a change of variables. Let \(v(x) = u(\alpha x)\). Then,
%     \[
%         \nabla v(x) = \alpha \nabla u (\alpha x)
%     \]
%     and
%     \begin{equation*}
%         \alpha^2\lambda_n(\alpha \Omega) = \min_{\substack{u \in E^\perp_{n-1} \\ u \neq 0}} \frac{\int_{\Omega} \abs{\alpha\nabla u(\alpha x)}^2 dx}{\int_{\Omega} u(\alpha x)^2 dx} = \min_{\substack{u \in E^\perp_{n-1} \\ u \neq 0}} \frac{\int_{\Omega} \abs{\nabla v(x)}^2 dx}{\int_{\Omega} v(x)^2 dx} = \lambda_n(\Omega).
%     \end{equation*}

% \end{proof}
